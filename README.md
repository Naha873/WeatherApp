# WeatherApp

### Project introduction and proposal
**Project Goals**

This project aims to develop an internal weather application for company employees. It will provide accurate and timely weather information for various locations, enhancing employee operational efficiency and reducing third party dependencies. Furthermore, this project will foster a culture of innovation and learning within the development team to evaluate current processes and assess areas improvements. 

**API Selection and Development Approach**

The app will initially utilise the open-meteo.com weather API and geocoding API due to its free access. However, the project team should conduct a thorough evaluation of all API options in the long term. This evaluation should consider factors such as cost, data accuracy, feature set, and API limits to determine the most suitable solution for the project budget and requirements.

**Agile Development Methodology**

As I aim to have an iterative approach to adding features to the app, I will be using an agile development methodology. This approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation based on user feedback and evolving needs. I used the Scrum framework, working in sprints to develop this app which was â€¦.
